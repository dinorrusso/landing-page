# Odin Project Landing Page
![alt text](info/01.png)

The goal of this project was to use HTML and CSS to duplicate a landing page like the image above.

*Note that this project followed lessons on using Flex for positioning.*

After duplicating the page above, I decided to modify the project to look like a "real-ish" page and made some style changes.

---

Lessons learned:
- If you style a common element (e.g. an anchor) for a specific purpose, you had better use a specific class for the style, otherwise you might lose an hour or two chasing down a formatting issue.  In my case, I had added padding to the links in heading, but then when I added a caption containing links under the main image, it displayed wonky.  I finally figured it out but it took too long!
- Save your changes often, especially when experimenting.  The ability to roll back is a life saver.
